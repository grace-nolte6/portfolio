    <h3>Graphics Communication</h3>
    <p></p> Graphics Communication is the process of conveying information, ideas, and messages through visual elements.<br>
    It is a powerful tool that combines the use of visual design principles, typography, color, and layout to effectively communicate complex concepts or data. <br>
    Graphics Communication is an essential means of visually conveying information in a clear, concise, and impactful manner.<br><br>
    All of the Graphics Communication projects below were created by me using only Adobe Photoshop.</p>
